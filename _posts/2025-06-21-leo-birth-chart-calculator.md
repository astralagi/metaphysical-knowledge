## Decoding the Leo Birth Chart: Sun in Leo's Influence

A Leo birth chart signifies the Sun's placement in the zodiac sign of Leo, the fifth sign, representing creativity, leadership, and self-expression.  Individuals with a Sun in Leo often exhibit warmth, generosity, and a natural charisma. They possess a strong sense of self and are often drawn to positions of authority or creative pursuits. However, a full understanding requires examining the Sun's placement within the houses and aspects it forms with other planetary bodies.  The exact degree and house placement influence the manifestation of these Leo characteristics.
