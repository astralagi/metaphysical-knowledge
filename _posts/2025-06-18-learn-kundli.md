## Detailed Explanation of 'Learn Kundli'

A Kundli is a complex astrological chart created using the precise time, date, and place of your birth.  It depicts the positions of the planets and constellations at that moment, revealing the energies and influences shaping your life. Learning a Kundli involves understanding the placement of the planets in the twelve houses (representing different life areas like career, relationships, and health), the signs they occupy, and their aspects.  Key concepts to grasp include:

* **Lagna (Ascendant):** The rising sign at the time of birth, signifying your personality and outward expression.
* **Planets:** Each planet represents different energies and influences (e.g., Sun – vitality, Moon – emotions, Mars – action).
* **Houses:** Each house represents a specific area of life, providing insights into your experiences in those domains.
* **Nakshatras (Constellations):** These lunar mansions add another layer of detail and nuance to planetary interpretations.
